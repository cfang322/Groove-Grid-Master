# JavaScript-Project-Groove-Grid-Master

## Background

Groove Grid Master is an electronic musical instrument designed to for musicians and electronic music enthusiasts in creating dynamic and expressive compositions. This device consists of a grid of clickable pads, each representing a distinct musical note, instrument, or sound sample. Users can interact with the pads by tapping or clicking on them, manipulating various parameters like pitch, volume, and effects in real-time. The sound step sequencer will move from left to right, playing each row of notes at a time, in a rhythmic tempo/beat. This electronic music pad/grid offers a new and immersive way for artists to explore and express their musical ideas.


## Functionality & MVPs

In Groove Grid Master, users will be able to:

### Start, Pause, and Reset:
    Allow users to start the Groove Grid Master simulation, pause it, and reset the grid to its initial state. This functionality ensures users have control over the playback and can experiment with different musical compositions.

### Interactive Grid:
    Enable users to click or tap on individual pads within the grid to activate or deactivate the sounds. Users can change which pads are on and off in real time, so that it can feel like a real instrument. Users will also be able to save their composition if they like what they created. 

### Parameter Manipulation:
    Implement real-time manipulation of various parameters. It will have sliders for volume and pitch as well as a drop down for effects or different instruments so users can experiment with various types of sound combinations. Users should be able to adjust these parameters as the simulation is running, allowing for on-the-fly customization and creativity.

### User-Friendly Interface:
    Design a user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless interaction, like playing a real instrument. This includes clear controls for starting, pausing, and resetting the simulation, as well as sliders and buttons for adjusting musical parameters.

In addition, this project will include:

- Instructions and a README for the users.
- A dynamic and visually appealing music grid.
