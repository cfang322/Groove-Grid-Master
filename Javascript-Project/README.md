# JavaScript-Project-Groove-Grid-Master

## Background

Groove Grid Master is an innovative musical instrument designed to empower musicians and electronic music enthusiasts in creating dynamic and expressive compositions. This device consists of a grid of clickable pads, each representing a distinct musical note or sound sample. Users can interact with the pads by tapping or clicking on them, manipulating various parameters like pitch, volume, and effects in real-time. The device is equipped with a user-friendly interface that provides a versatile platform for live performances, studio recordings, and creative experimentation. This electronic music pad/grid serves as an intuitive and customizable tool, bridging the gap between traditional instruments and modern digital music production, offering a new and immersive way for artists to explore and express their musical ideas.


## Functionality & MVPs

In Groove Grid Master, users will be able to:

### Start, Pause, and Reset:
    Allow users to start the Groove Grid Master simulation, pause it, and reset the grid to its initial state. This functionality ensures users have control over the playback and can experiment with different musical compositions.

### Interactive Grid:
    Enable users to click or tap on individual pads within the grid to activate or deactivate them, representing musical notes or sound samples. This interactive grid serves as the canvas for users to craft their dynamic and expressive compositions.

### Preset Demo Initial States:
    Provide users with the option to choose from preset demo initial states for the grid. These presets can serve as starting points or inspiration for users who may want to explore specific musical patterns or styles.

### Parameter Manipulation:
    Implement real-time manipulation of various parameters, including pitch, volume, and effects. Users should be able to adjust these parameters as the simulation is running, allowing for on-the-fly customization and creativity.

### User-Friendly Interface:
    Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless interaction. This includes clear controls for starting, pausing, and resetting the simulation, as well as sliders or knobs for adjusting musical parameters.

In addition, this project will include:

- Instructions and a README for the users.
- A dynamic and visually appealing music grid.


## Wireframes

- Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, my LinkedIn, and the About modal.
- Controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the speed.
- Above the grid, there will be clickable buttons used to toggle between color schemes.


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
